## Security Policy

### Supported Versions
- We support the most recent major release of the GitKraken CLI along with the latest patch release of the previous major version.
- Older releases continue to receive community support, but they will not receive regular security fixes.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report suspected vulnerabilities through the GitHub Security Advisories workflow for this repository so the report stays private while we investigate.
- If you prefer email, contact the GitKraken security team at security@gitkraken.com with a descriptive subject line.
- Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, affected versions, potential impact, proposed mitigations, and proof-of-concept code if available).
- Do **not** open public GitHub issues or discuss details in public forums until we publish an advisory.

### Response Process
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- Our triage process typically completes within 7 business days; we will let you know if we require additional time or information.
- Once validated, we will work with you to coordinate disclosure, develop a fix, and schedule a release.
- When the fix is ready, we will publish an advisory crediting you (if you wish) and provide guidance for mitigation.

Thank you for helping us keep GitKraken CLI secure!
